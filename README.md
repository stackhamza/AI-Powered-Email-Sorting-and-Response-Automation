# 👕 MensWear Shop – n8n AI Automation Workflow  

> **Automating Customer Communication with Smart Workflow Intelligence**  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

The **MensWear Shop Automation Workflow** simplifies order management by automatically reading order details from a **Google Sheet** and sending customers the appropriate email updates according to their order status.  
Delivered orders are skipped, while customers with other statuses (such as *Processing, Returned, Cancelled,* or *Refund Request*) receive automated email updates.  

---

## 🧩 Workflow Structure  

The automation is created using **n8n**, and it follows this logical flow:

1. **Trigger:**  
   The workflow starts manually by clicking **"Execute Workflow"** in n8n.

2. **Read Data from Google Sheet:**  
   The Google Sheets node reads customer information including:
   - Customer ID  
   - Customer Name  
   - Email  
   - Phone Number  
   - Order Status  
   - Date  
   - Product  

3. **Filter Node:**  
   The workflow filters out all rows where the order status is **“Delivered”** to ensure only pending or actionable statuses are processed.

4. **Switch Node:**  
   The Switch node routes the remaining orders based on their **Order Status**, allowing for specific actions and delays for each type:
   - **Order Returned** → Wait 10s → Send Email  
   - **Order Cancelled** → Wait 3s → Send Email  
   - **Refund Request** → Wait 6s → Send Email  
   - **Order Processing** → Wait 15s → Send Email  

5. **Email Notifications:**  
   Each email is sent through a **Gmail Node** using customized templates that correspond to each order status.

|--------|-------------|
| Customer ID | Unique ID for each customer |
| Customer Name | Name of the customer |
| Email | Customer email address |
